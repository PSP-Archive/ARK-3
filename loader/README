ARK.BIN loader that works no matter where it's loaded in RAM.

load address/size/file are defined at the bottom of the asm file.

It passes the savedata folder path, example,
	ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/LOL IM A SAVEDATA FOLDER PATH NOW USE ME TO LOAD ARK.BIN .D-<-</

The path is grabbed from the original binloader path so you might want to strcpy it somewhere else in ARK.BIN.

Update:
The path is now copied to 0x08803800.
